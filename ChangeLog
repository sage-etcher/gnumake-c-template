    Git no longer ignores root folders named "install".

    * .gitignore: removed the line "install/**", because such a
    folder shouldn't exist. Secondly, on the windows platform the INSTALL file
    makes having a folder named such impossible.

    Git should now grab the "Empty" directories.

    * resources/.gitkeep: created an empty file to log directory

    * source/lib/.gitkeep: created an empty file to log directory
